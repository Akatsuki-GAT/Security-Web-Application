# Security-Web-Application

PHP(blade.php) 8.2.12 + JS + CSS + MySQL and Laravel Framework 12.49.0 with Composer 2.9.5 and API named Enzoic in strength checking of Password in Registration

The only feature working as of now is the password strength meter is Enzoic, a client-side password intelligence.
+ Reads the password as the user types
+ Scores strength (weak / medium / strong)

What needs to be done is to:
- Making the next page after login or regsiter doesn't get accessed by URL 
- Adding a demo database for basic CRUD
- Deciding whether to add and then finalize Admin route pages route or not as this one was originally users only
- Going back to demo database making sure it is translated to Laravel readablity from its old PHP functions and structure

As of now I, Joshua Ulrik G. Galano perform and plan this task as the packages of making Laravel function is heavy and require lots of tinkering like 
Composer, mySQL and PHP(XAMPP takes care of it) as I don't know if my other members machine spec is available or at a low end that running may crash or not run at all.

The register, login, and localrun is on IAS folder which contain images of it.
